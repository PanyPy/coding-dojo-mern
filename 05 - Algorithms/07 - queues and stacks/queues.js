Queues Basic
SLQueue: Enqueue
Create SLQueue method enqueue(val) to add the given value to the end of our queue. Remember, SLQueue uses a singly linked list (not an array).

SLQueue: Front
Create SLQueue method front() to return the value at front of our queue, without removing it.

SLQueue: Is Empty
Create SLQueue method isEmpty() that returns whether our queue contains no values.

SLQueue: Compare Queues
Given two SLQueue objects, create a standalone function that returns whether they are equal. Queues are equal only if they have equal elements in identical order. Allocate no other object, and return the queues in their original condition upon exit.

SLQueue: Dequeue
Create SLQueue method dequeue() to remove and return value at front of the queue. Remember, SLQueue uses singly linked list (not array).

SLQueue: Contains
Create method contains(val) to return whether given value is found in our queue.

SLQueue: Size
Create SLQueue method size() that returns the number of values in our queue.

SLQueue: Remove Minimums
Create a standalone function to remove an SLQueueâ€™s lowest value, otherwise leaving values in the same sequence. Use only local
variables; allocate no other objects. Remove all duplicates of this value.
Bonus: Remove only the last minimum value. Convert [7,2,5,2,4] to [7,2,5,4].

SLQueue: Interleave Queue
Reorder SLQueue values to alternate first half values with second-half values, in order. For example: (1,2,3,4,5) becomes (1,4,2,5,3). You may create one additional SLQueue if needed.
