Stack Implementation Based on Array
Build essential methods push, pop, top, contains, isEmpty, size for ArrStack using an array. Make sure you designate the underlying array as private (declared var), not public (attached to this).

ArrStack: Push. Create push(val) that adds val to our stack.
ArrStack: Top. Return (not remove) the stackâ€™s top value. 
ArrStack: Is Empty. Return whether the stack is empty.
ArrStack: Pop. Create pop() to remove and return the top val.
ArrStack: Contains. Return whether given val is within the stack.
ArrStack: Size. Return the number of stacked values.
